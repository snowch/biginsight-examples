  * **Overview** - This section includes the following:
    * Explanation of the application and its purpose. Answer the questions:
      * Why is this sample app relevant to the target persona?
      *	What purpose does this sample app serve?
      *	What does the sample app do?
    * Services that are used and why

  * **Devloper experience**: List any requirements for using the example.
  
  * **Application Requirements** (if any): List any requirements for using the example, like browser and version. Include an architecture diagram if the app is anything more than a Demo.
  
  * **Run the example**: All samples should lay out step by step instructions on how to run it, including setting up dependencies.

	  * **Running Instructions**: Instructions on how to run the example after cloning the repo. Assume little to no prior Bluemix experience.
	    * Needs to have sanity checks at about every 20 steps
	    * Think accessibility first. If any tools are used (i.e. the CF CLI), briefly explain what the tools are for and how they are used.
	    * Avoid directly referencing Bluemix UI components here; doing this helps avoid ACE changes invalidating your README
	    * This section tends to be large and/or subject to changes. In order to limit the changes  needed for your README, you can choose to:
	      * Embed steps in another Instructions.md file and link there
	      * Include a link to a tutorial hosted on a separate site (i.e. developerWorks or Bluemix Docs) instead

  * **Decomposition Instructions**: Instructions on how a developer/architect would take the sample application and extract the relevant code for reuse. For example, if the app is a "Hello World" to demonstrate integration of a specific service, explain what code is relevant to this integration and how one would reuse it.
  
  * **API Documentation**: If the sample app exposes an API, either include basic documentation, link to a Swagger/Apigee API, or something similar. Do not repeat API docs that are already published elsewhere.
  
  * **Contribution**: Note how you would like developers to contribute and/or log issues to your project. Also give steps for making pull requests. If your contribution directions become lengthy, break them out into a file called `CONTRIBUTING.md` and link to this. Use the [Puppet CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) file as a reference. On the contrary, if your app is static and you do not want the community to contribute, note this and that all pull requests will be rejected.
